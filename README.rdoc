= watirgrid

WatirGrid allows for distributed testing across a grid network using Watir.

Basic instructions are:

Pick a server to host the 'controller' for the ring server and execute the following:
$ ./controller.rb -l INFO

This should find your external facing IP and start the corresponding DRb and Ring Servers
DRb server started on: druby://192.168.1.105:11235
Ring server started on: druby://192.168.1.105:12358

On each client PC, host the 'provider' for the distributed watir objects
$  ./provider.rb -l INFO

This should find the recently started Ring Server and start a corresponding Ring Provider
DRb server started on: druby://192.168.1.105:64864
Ring Provider started.

You will now be able to execute commands across remote browsers on your grid network.
Check the watirgid_spec.rb for some examples
e.g.
grid = WatirGrid.new(:ring_server_port => 12358)
grid.start
threads = []
grid.browsers.each { |browser|
    threads << Thread.new do 
        browser.goto("http://www.google.com")
        browser.text_field(:name, 'q').set("watirgrid")
        browser.button(:name, "btnI").click
    end
}
threads.each {|thread| thread.join}
